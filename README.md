How can you see into my eyes, like open doors <br />
Leading you down into my core <br />
Where I've become so numb, without a soul <br />
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold <br />
Until you find it there and lead it back home <br />

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up, <br />
Wake me up inside, save me, <br />
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up <br />
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up <br />
Before I come undone, save me <br />
Save me from the nothing I've become <br />

Now that I know what I'm without <br />
You can't just leave me <br />
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life <br />

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up, <br />
Wake me up inside, save me, <br />
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up <br />
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up <br />
Before I come undone, save me <br />
Save me from the nothing I've become <br />

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie <br />
There's nothing inside, bring me to life <br />

Frozen inside without your touch <br />
Without your love, darling <br />
Only you are the life among the dead <br />

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see <br />
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me <br />

I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems <br />
I've got to open my eyes to everything <br />

Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul <br />

Don't let me die here <br />
There must be something wrong, bring me to life <br />

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up, <br />
Wake me up inside, save me, <br />
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up <br />
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up <br />
Before I come undone, save me <br />
Save me from the nothing I've become <br />

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside <br />
Bring me to life
